This project let's you deploy a browser-based phone using the Twilio Client. It's magical.

When you deploy this project to Google App Engine and configure it based on your own Twilio credentials,
you will be able to call out and receive telephone calls right from your browser.

It supports three basic features. When you're logged into your app you can do the following...
<ul>
<li>You can make outbound calls to any number using the dial pad.</li>
<li>Your friends can login and make browser-to-browser calls to you.</li>
<li>Anyone can call your Twilio your number and they will be routed to your browser.</li>
</ul>

This is intended to be deployed on Google App Engine using Twilio. You are required to personalize the configuration by updating <strong>configuration.py</strong> in the following ways:

1. Configure your App Engine ID
2. Configure your Twilio account details
3. Configure your mobile phone number for account verification
4. Configure your application name and description
5. Configure your name
6. Configure the Google Analytics parameter

Also remember to update the App Engine ID in the app.yaml file before deploying.

Once you deploy the application, go to your app's homepage - http://myapp.appspot.com - and follow the instructions.
